# 🚀 Best Practices and Workflow Optimization with AI

## ✅ **Overview of the Project**

This project demonstrates the use of AI  to efficiently fix, refactor, and improve a broken web component: a **Pricing Card** layout. The original component had issues including broken layout, incorrect CSS properties, missing HTML tags, and unresponsive buttons.

The refactored result is a **clean, reusable, responsive Pricing Card component** that follows best practices in web development.
